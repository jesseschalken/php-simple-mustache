# simple-mustache-parser

A WIP simple [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) parser written in PHP.

At the moment the parser is fully functional, but there is no code to actually
execute the parsed document against template data.

Run tests with `./runtests.php`.

Parse a Mustache file and dump the syntax tree with `./parsestdin.php < my_template.mustache`.
